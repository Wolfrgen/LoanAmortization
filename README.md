# LoanAmortization
Takes upto 75,000 loans with variable interest rates and maturities ranging from 5 - 30 years (can be modified in included excel spreadsheet) and creates an aggregate loan amortization table with a feature that allows the user to see how many loans have been paid off in each period. Additionally, there is a formula I have developed which accounts for variable rates.
